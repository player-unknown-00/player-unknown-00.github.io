# GPO Backup Fails - Path Too Long

**Error:**  
GPO: ..Failed

The-overall eror was The system cannot find the path specified  
Additional details to follow.  

\[Error\] The task cannot be completed.  
There was an eror with extension \[Registry\] The \sysvoI\Policies  
\4DE1AAE7-BE73-41B8-806A-F1 1661E66A)\Machine\registry.pol\] cannot be accessed  
The following eror occured  
**The system cannot find the path specified**


**<u>Solution:</u>**

Windows (by default) limits full file paths to **260 characters** (MAX_PATH). This includes the drive letter, colon, backslashes, folder names, and the file name itself.  
So, if you're **extracting or copying GPOs** (or any files) into a folder structure that's already deeply nestedâ€”especially under something like:  
*C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\SomeLongFolderName\AnotherLongSubfolder\\..\\..\registry.pol*

-it can **exceed the limit**, causing **"The system cannot find the path specified"** errors, even though the file *does* exist.

**Why this impacts GPOs:**
- SYSVOL paths are already long: \\domain\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\\{GUID}\Machine\Staging\registry.pol
- If you extract or manipulate GPO backups from compressed files into deep folder structures in Explorer, the full path might exceed the limit.

**<u>Fixes and Workarounds:</u>**

**1. Enable Long Path Support (Windows 10/Server 2016+)**

You can lift the 260-character limit:
- Open gpedit.msc
- Go to:  
  *Local Computer Policy \> Computer Configuration \> Administrative Templates \> System \> Filesystem*
- Enable **"Enable Win32 long paths"**

Or set this in the registry:

\[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\]

"LongPathsEnabled"=dword:00000001

**2. Extract Files Closer to Root**

Instead of extracting to:

**C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Deep\Folder\Structure\\..**

Try extracting directly to:

**C:\Temp**

**3. Use PowerShell with UNC or Shortened Paths**

You can use tools like robocopy, xcopy, or PowerShell to manipulate paths even beyond 260 characters by prepending with **\\?\\**:

```powershell
Copy-Item "\\?\C:\Very\Long\Path\To\File.txt" -Destination "\\?\C:\Shorter\Path"
```
