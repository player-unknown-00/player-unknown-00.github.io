# Creating a custom favicon for you Chirpy-themed blog

- Create the favicons - I suggest using:  https://favicon.io/  
As this site will zip up all the necessary favicon files for you and name them correctly.

- Once done, download the file from the site and unzip.  
- Keep All files (you can delete the about.txt)

- Now rename the folder to **"favicons"**  
- In your GitHub repo:
    - In the "assets" folder, create a new folder called **"img"**
    - Now place the "favicon" folder in /assets/img
    - So the path to your favicons will be /assets/img/favicons/favicon_files

Boom, done!
