# GPedit Error - Corrupted Registry.pol File

GPedit.msc error: The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid.

I was facing this error in one of my servers while trying to open gpedit, with additional message “The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid”.

**<u>Issue</u>**
While trying to open Gpedit on a server, seeing the following message:
"The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid".

In some cases, it affects remote desktop access to the server.

**<u>Cause</u>**
The underlying cause of the issue. Cause is an optional field as it is not appropriate or necessary for some types of articles.
This seems to be caused due to GPOs not being enforced properly on the server, causing a corrupted GPO file.

**<u>Resolution</u>**
1.  Enable view hidden files from explorer.
2.  Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine
3.  Rename the file Registry.pol to something else.
4.  Run gpupdate
